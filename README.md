## Robot movement <br/>
The keys represent the following maneuvers: <br/>
• *u* key is responsible for driving forward with the front wheels turned to the right, <br/>
• *i* key is responsible for moving forward with the front wheels in the starting position, <br/>
• *o* key is responsible for driving forward with the front wheels turned to the left, <br/>
• *j* key is responsible for turning the front wheels to the right, <br/>
• *k* key stops movement, <br/>
• *l* key is responsible for turning the front wheels to the left, <br/>
• *m* key is responsible for driving backwards with the front wheels turned to the right, <br/>
• *,* key is responsible for driving backwards with the front wheels in the starting position, <br/>
• *.* key is responsible for driving backwards with the front wheels turned to the left. <br/>
